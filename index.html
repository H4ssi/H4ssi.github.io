       <h1>Learning Clojure</h1><p>Hi and welcome to this ongoing series about me learning howto Clojure.</p><p>I plan to document my process, so that you may benefit from my experiences.</p><p>Since I by myself are already a programmer and quite confident in writing serious and effective Java code, this blog will be probably be most helpful, if you are already a programmer. (But you may of course feel free to read my blog regardless of your profession)</p><p>My approach to learning a new programming language is by example: So hopefully in the near future there will be some interesting code available on my github page. In the next few posts, we will try produce a somewhat useable static blog engine. (So if you are reading this, its code must already be available for you to explore)</p><p>So the next post I will explain why I chose to learn Clojure, and not any other language.</p><p>Stay tuned</p><p>- H4ssi</p></div>
