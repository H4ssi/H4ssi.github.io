Hi and welcome to this ongoing series about me learning howto Clojure.

I plan to document my process, so that you may benefit from my experiences.

Since I by myself are already a programmer and quite confident in writing serious and effective Java code, this blog will be probably be most helpful, if you are already a programmer. ((But you may of course feel free to read my blog regardless of your profession))

My approach to learning a new programming language is by example: So hopefully in the near future there will be some interesting code available on my github page. In the next few posts, we will try produce a somewhat useable static blog engine. ((So if you are reading this, its code must already be available for you to explore))

So the (link Why%20Clojure.html next post) I will explain why I chose to learn Clojure, and not any other language.

Stay tuned
