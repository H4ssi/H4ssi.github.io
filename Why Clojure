So why do I think, learning Clojure is worthwhile? For me, I think it boils down to three key points:

(h Platform support
   Clojure is available on some serious platforms

    
   (h Java Virtual Machine
      Nowadays this is a really attractive platform, available on nearly every PC and there are some fine programs, that prove that the JVM indeed is a viable platform. ((my favorite example is (link https://minecraft.net Minecraft)))
      And if you think about doing enterprisey software, the JVM is the platform of choice anyways.
   )

   (h JavaScript
      (b The) platform of the web! Currently there is no way you can do better on the web. So there is this thing called ClojureScript which essentially takes Clojure code, and compiles it down to JavaScript, so you can run it in your browser.
      And besides: nowadays it is hip again to run JavaScript on the server side. ((free cookies, yay!))
   )

   (h Android
      I am not sure, how stable and mature this already is, but there is the outlook, that ((since the JVM and the Android Dalvik plattforms are so similar)) you may run your Clojure code on you android device.
   )

   So technically, it could be possible to one day, you take a piece of Clojure code and run it on any PC, any Browser, any Server, your phone, your tablet and even your TV. I think this is quite appealing.

(h Ecosystem
   Especially when targetting the JVM, there is already a large pool of usuable components to build upon. This is mostly due to a very popular language to the JVM called Java, which happens to be compatible to Clojure. How convinient!
   Additionally there is already all the infrastructure to distribute those components in the form of maven, or even - since we are going to do Clojure - Leiningen. This makes packaging clojure apps ridicoulusly easy.
)

(h Functional by default, imperative by choice
   Personally I think, this is going to be the future of programming languages. If you happened to learn, how a purely functional language works, you mind was probably blown. But then again, you need to account for statefulness and side effects in computers. This is the part where it usually gets complicated, when using purely functional languages. So I think languages should encourage the programmer, to keep it functional, whilst allowing them fall back to an imperative style of
   programming, if there is a need to do so.
   I think Clojure does a pretty good job in this respect.
)

(h Other goodies
   Discovering other Clojure goodies is left as an excercise for the reader. In the next post, we will try to build some Clojure apps in the next post.
