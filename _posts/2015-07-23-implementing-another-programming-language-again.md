Finally this blog setup is done! Quick shoutout to [Jekyll][jekyll] for enabling all this.

Lets do a quick round-up on what I am planning to blog about:

Currently I am working on [pint][pint], a programming language. This will mostly be an experience, and I thought I'll try to share some of it.

For the perfect experience I am mixing together stuff, we developers love

- it's a programming languages (:heart:)
- it's made for game development (:heart:)
- in particular for browser games (not sure if I really like this, but the browser is a cool platform)
- it's lispy (:heart: :heart:)

Please do not be to harsh on me, if this does not mix well. So far this is mostly a vision. Consider these points more like "guiding principles". Hopefully in the end there will be something, that resembles these points somehow; for now only time will tell.

Stay tuned for a more elaborate motiviation. Right now I am mostly happy that I started this blog!

Cheers, H4ssi!
